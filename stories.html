            <br>Name: Keywam Tafteh</br>
            <br>Age: 20</br>
            <br>Location: Los Angeles</br> 
            <br>So why does this type of fashion matter?</br> 
            <br>
            No cultural discipline should discriminate against its audience, and as fashion mines the creativity of non-binary communities, it should also represent them, recognising both their influence and catering to their desires, as well as to those who consider their gender to be binary, but don't subscribe to repressive ideas about what they should therefore be wearing. Gender is a social construct, and you should be able to dress it up however you like, conforming to or subverting old-school fashion rules in any way that excites you, or simply makes you feel comfortable. Fashion should allow us to explore our identities and empower us to find an expression that makes us happy, and ultimately more free. Understanding and responding to the infinite nature of human diversity and creativity, no matter how technology and social expectations change, is undoubtedly the key to the fashion industry's future.</br>
            <br>What is fashion, if not the promise that you may create yourself, however you see fit?</br>
            <br>Though women's wardrobes today contain a range of garments that would traditionally have been considered menswear, men have tended to stick exclusively to conventionally masculine styles. But things are changing. A combination of factors, from fashion's influence on male music stars, particularly rappers, who in turn influence their audiences, to broader trends in society - the move toward a more fluid conception of gender and sexuality; the questioning of body image expectations; discussion of women's equality and liberation; respect for other cultures and queer lifestyles - has changed the context of more experimental fashion choices: when there are no negative connotations to being a girl or being gay, there isn't such pressure to constantly demonstrate your maleness and heterosexuality by rigidly sticking to a conventionally masculine appearance.</br>
            <br>When thinking of genderless fashion and the 
            future of it in the industry, what it represented to me was a vision of the future so frequently explored on the catwalk and in fashion editorials, where every person, regardless of their sex or gender identity, has the freedom to express themselves through whatever fashion they feel comfortable in, and indeed fabulous in.</br>

            <br>Why is it so hard for us to get away from these fashion identifiers?</br>

             <br>I don't think they are necessarily bad for each gender, but they are limiting. It's not wrong for a woman to enjoy the stereotypically female type of clothing, nor is it bad for a man to like wearing the clothes he has always seen on other men, but it is sad and uncalled for when someone is shamed for dressing outside of the gendered boxes we've created. Once upon a time, there was a man and there was a woman, and they could wear whatever they want.</br>
