           <p><br>TRIBES</br><br>So why does this type of fashion matter? 
            Why is it currently trending in the industry, 
            and where will it go from here? We are at a 
            crux in history where gender identity is being 
            challenged and explored and made public. 
            Even though it's still controversial, it's not as 
            uncommon to discuss gender roles.</br><br>LGBTQ rights, and other matters of personal 
            identity. Unisex, multi-sex, a-sex, or genderless 
            fashion, whatever you want to call it, is highly 
            appealing to a generation who is tired of the 
            stereotypes and who'd like to see any and all 
            identities accepted.</br><br>Is genderless fashion eliminating sex? 
            I think the answer is yes and no. Yes in that 
            traditional ideas of womanhood and manhood 
            are seemingly erased, but no because the 
            wearer of the clothes still gets to bring forth 
            their personality. True genderless fashion isn't 
            a man wearing feminine clothing or a woman 
            wearing masculine clothing. It is, IMO, a human 
            wearing clothing fit for either.</br><br>When thinking of genderless fashion and the 
            future of it in the industry, I know my mind 
            tends to recreate images of clothes worn in 
            some dystopian society in a film â€” a type of 
            clothing that eliminates individuality and 
            traditional definition of gender and makes 
            a group of people equal in its sameness. 
            That's not where I'd like to see this fashion 
            trend go. I hope to see genderless fashion 
            become not just a trend but a stepping stone 
            for progress in equality of the sexes. 
            I think it's advantageous in that we might
            be able to stop seeing people through the 
            eyes of societal limitations of genders and 
            rather possessing the strengths of both 
            woman and man.</br><br>A part of these expectations and ideals is the type of clothing one wears as a woman or a man. Clothing has throughout history inherently identified people as either of the genders, as a member of some social class, or as some part of the professional world.</br><br>Why is it so hard for us to get away from these fashion identifiers? I don't think they are necessarily bad for each gender, but they are limiting. It's not wrong for a woman to enjoy the stereotypically female type of clothing, nor is it bad for a man to like wearing the clothes he has always seen on other men, but it is sad and uncalled for when someone is shamed for dressing outside of the gendered boxes we've created.</br>
